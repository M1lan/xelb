X protocol Emacs Lisp Binding
=============================

XELB (X protocol Emacs Lisp Binding) is a pure Elisp implementation of the X
protocol based on the XML description files from XCB project. It features an
object-oriented API and permits a certain degree of concurrency.

While XELB is developed and tested on Emacs 25, it should also work on recent
versions of Emacs 24.
